Prioritize type safety, clarity, and maintainability by defining explicit types, organizing code logically by feature, handling asynchronous operations and errors effectively, and strictly adhering to a functional programming paradigm, actively avoiding object-oriented programming (OOP). Emphasize immutability, pure functions, and the composition of functions. Structure your code using functions as the primary building blocks. Prefer immutable data structures and minimize side effects. Design well-documented public APIs that primarily expose functions, types, and interfaces, rather than classes.
