Write code that prioritizes intrinsic readability and maintainability through evocative naming, logical structure, and self-explanatory code, while embracing modularity and separation of concerns to create focused, well-defined components. Minimize nesting depth by handling edge cases and exit conditions early, favoring early exits (returns, throws, continues, breaks, etc.) over deeply nested conditional blocks to maintain a clear and linear flow of execution. Optimize for inherent efficiency by selecting appropriate algorithmic approaches and avoiding redundancy, and ensure inherent correctness and robustness by anticipating potential issues and handling errors gracefully. Adhere to established design principles conceptually to promote well-structured and adaptable code, emphasizing a deep understanding of the problem domain to produce solutions that are not only functional but also elegant and aligned with best practices, all achievable without reliance on external tools.
